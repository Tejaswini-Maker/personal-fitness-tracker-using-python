Personal Fitness Tracker Using Python
Overview
The Personal Fitness Tracker is a Python-based application that helps users track their fitness progress by predicting calories burned during exercise. It processes user inputs such as age, BMI, heart rate, body temperature, and exercise duration to provide an accurate estimate. The project is implemented using Streamlit for the frontend and Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook for data processing.

Features
🏋️‍♂️ Calorie Prediction: Uses machine learning to estimate calories burned

📊 Data Analysis: Compares user fitness stats with dataset records

🌐 Streamlit Web App: Simple UI to interact with the prediction model

📁 Dataset Processing: Reads exercise.csv and calories.csv to generate insights
